# Decartes
English | [简体中文](README_CN.md) 

The essence of testing is exhaustive.  how to exhaust all possibilities to find bugs, it is a greate challenge. You shouldn‘t do it manually, You should do it with a machine. Language **Decartes** make it. which core is the **Cartesian product** and **permutation** algorithm.

# Philosophy

inspired from tcl,  has philosopy

1. every grammar is `command` 
2. every data is string, 
4. interpreted language
4. small enough
5. easy to extend your own grammar,
